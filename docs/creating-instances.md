# Creating instances

## Usage

Linux/macOS is recommended for building instances. However, Windows should also work

If you don't have Rust installed, get it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)

Clone the repository and go to the `instance_builder` directory:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>/instance_builder
```

Then, you'll need to create a `spec.json` file. It's used to define launcher instances that should be created. The file format is described below. You can also find an example config at [`instance_builder/spec.example.json`](https://github.com/Petr1Furious/potato_launcher/blob/master/instance_builder/spec.example.json)

After defining your instance, you can build it with the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release -p instance_builder -- -s <path to spec.json>
```

This will create a `generated` directory, which should then be uploaded to your server. If you followed the [Server configuration](/setting-up/server) guide, you should upload the contents of this directory (not the directory itself) to the `data` subdirectory of your launcher dir, e.g. to `/srv/potatosmp/data`. You can use the `exec_after_all` setting to automate this process.

## Fields


### Root Fields

- **download_server_base** (required): The base URL where the instance will be deployed. All files in the generated folder (`generated` by default) must be accessible by `<download_server_base>/<file_relative_path>` after deployment. For example, the version manifest has to be at `<download_server_base>/version_manifest.json`. You probably want this set to `https://your.domain/data`
- **resources_url_base**: The base URL for assets. Should be equal to `<download_server_base>/assets/objects` if the generated folder structure is not changed after upload. If omitted, the launcher will download assets from Mojang servers. Unset by default
- **replace_download_urls**:
  If set to `true`, all instance files will be downloaded from your server.
  
  If set to `false`, the original download URLs will be kept when possible. This means that assets, libraries, modloaders and the Minecraft jar will be downloaded from their original locations and only metadata, files specified in `include`, and (Neo)Forge patched jars will be downloaded from your server.
  
  Default: `false`
- **version_manifest_url**: The URL from which to fetch a remote version manifest. If specified, the instance builder will fetch the existing manifest from this URL and merge the local versions with it, preserving any versions that exist in the remote manifest but not in the local specification.

  In other words, set this to `<download_server_base>/version_manifest.json` if you want to manage different instances from different devices (for example, when you have multiple server admins responsible for different servers).
- **versions** (required): An array of version specification objects (see below for details).
- **exec_before_all**: A console command to execute before processing all versions.
- **exec_after_all**: A console command to execute after processing all versions. This is useful for automatically deploying the generated files (for example, by `rsync`'ing them to a server with `nginx`).

  If you followed the [Server configuration](/setting-up/server) guide and are running Linux/macOS on your machine, you can use the `chmod -R +r ./generated && rsync -za --info=progress2 ./generated/ user@server:/srv/potatosmp/data/` command here. Note the trailing slashes; they matter in rsync!

### Version Fields

- **name** (required): The name of the instance.
- **minecraft_version** (required): The Minecraft version for this instance.
- **loader_name**: The name of the modloader ("vanilla", "fabric", "forge" or "neoforge"). Default: `"vanilla"`
- **loader_version**: The version of the modloader. Defaults to `"latest"` for Fabric and `"recommended"` for (Neo)Forge
- **include**: An array of inclusion rules. Each rule is an object with the following fields:
  - **path** (required): The file or directory (relative to the `include_from` directory) to include.
  - **overwrite**: A boolean indicating if the included file(s) should always be overwritten. Default: `true`
  - **delete_extra**: If set to true along with `overwrite: true`, extra files in the target directory will be deleted. Default: `true`
  - **recursive**:
    If set to `true`, missing files from this directory will be re-downloaded every time the instance is synchronized. If set to `false`, this directory will be ignored after it's downloaded for the first time. Has no effect on files or with `overwrite: true`. Default: `false`.
- **include_from**: A directory from which to include files. For example, it can be a path to a PrismLauncher instance with your modpack. Required if `include` contains entries.
- **auth_backend**: The Minecraft authentication provider required for this instance. If omitted, any provider can be selected by users. See below for the list of providers and their config settings
  - **type**: The authentication provider name
  - Any additional fields for the selected authentication provider
- **recommended_xmx**: The instance's default JVM RAM limit (`-Xmx`). Should be a string with `M` or `G` suffix (for example, "8192M"). If no suffix is given, `M` is assumed. Currently defaults to `4096M` when unset
- **exec_before**: A command to execute before processing this version
- **exec_after**: A command to execute after processing this version

## Authentication providers

Currently, the following authentication backends/providers are supported:

- `"mojang"`: The official authentication server. Requires no parameters
- `"telegram"`: [tgauth](https://foxlab.dev/minecraft/tgauth-backend). Requires `"auth_base_url"` parameter to be set to the base URL of the tgauth server, e.g. `"https://your.auth.server"`
- `"ely.by"`: [ely.by](https://ely.by). To use this provider, you need to create a "Web site" application at https://account.ely.by/dev/applications. Parameters: `"client_id"`, `"client_secret"`
